This is my fork of this project Literate Programming fork of the
original Emacs Starter Kit which is located at
http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/.

You may find resent code on
https://github.com/ai81/emacs-configuration

Part of original readme:

This should provide a saner set of defaults than you get normally with
Emacs. It's intended for beginners, but provides a good elisp
initialization structure for all levels of users.

The main advantage of this Emacs Starter Kit are
- better default settings
- inclusion of many useful libraries
- "literate" customization embedded in Org-mode files
- an organizational directory structure
- git provides for version control, backup, and sharing

The latest version is at http://github.com/eschulte/emacs-starter-kit/
